# Conway's Game of Life in Python

This is a simple Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in less than 150 lines and in 30 minutes. The simulation runs in the terminal shell using ASCII characters.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Python 3 installed** on your system.

2. **Save the code** to a file (e.g  `game_of_life.py`).

3. **Open your terminal shell** and enlarge it to display the entire game board (default is 50x50 cells).

4. **Run the script** using:
   ```bash
   python3 game_of_life.py

5.  **Exit the program manually** when desired by pressing (The program should manually exit after the simulation is finished though)
    ```bash 
    Ctrl + C

Try adjusting randint parameter for more/less initial cell life, and time parameters for quicker/slower generations. This also prints out new databoards each generation, so the frame changing might look a little off.
